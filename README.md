`sleuth` is a Go library that provides master-less peer-to-peer autodiscovery and RPC
between HTTP services that reside on the same network. It works with minimal
configuration and provides a mechanism to join a local network both as a
client that offers no services and as any service that speaks HTTP. Its
primary use case is for microservices on the same network that make calls to
one another.

## Installation
`sleuth` is dependent on [`libzmq`](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq), which can be installed either from source or from binaries. For more information, please refer to [Ã˜MQ: "Get the Software"](http://zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software) or the [`libzmq` repository](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq).

Once `libzmq` is available on a system, `sleuth` can be installed like any other Go library:

```
go get -u github.com/ursiform/sleuth
```

## Test
    go test -cover github.com/ursiform/sleuth

## Q & A

**Q**: What is the messaging protocol `sleuth` uses?

**A**: Under the hood, `sleuth` marshals HTTP requests and responses into plain JSON objects and then compresses them via `gzip`. Instead of adding another dependency on something like Protocol Buffers, `sleuth` depends on the fact that most API responses between microservices will be fairly small and it leaves the door open to ports in a wide variety of languages and environments. One hard dependency seemed quite enough.

**Q**: It doesn't work.

**A**: That's not a question. But have you checked to make sure your firewall allows `UDP` traffic on port `5670`?

**Q**: Why is it called `sleuth`?

**A**: Because "sleuth" is the collective noun for a group of bears: the original reason for writing this library was to connect a group of [bear](https://github.com/ursiform/bear)/[forest](https://github.com/ursiform/forest) services. Also because a sleuth searches for things and discovers them. Hence the logo:
